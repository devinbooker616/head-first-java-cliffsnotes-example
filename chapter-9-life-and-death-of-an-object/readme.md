- instance variables live within the object they belong to, on the Heap.
- If the instance variable is a reference to an object, both the reference and the object it refers to are on the Heap.
- A constructor is the code that runs when you say new on a class type.
- A constructor must have the same name as the class, and must not have a return type.
- You can use a constructor to initialize the state (i.e. the instance variables) of the object being constructed.
- If you don’t put a constructor in your class, the compiler will put in a default constructor. The default constructor is always a no-arg constructor.
- If you put a constructor—any constructor—in your class, the compiler will not build the default constructor.
- If you want a no-arg constructor, and you’ve already put in a constructor with arguments, you’ll have to build the no-arg constructor yourself.
- Always provide a no-arg if you can, to make it easy for programmers to make a working object. Supply default values.
- Overloaded constructors means you have more than one constructor in your class.
- Overloaded constructors must have different argument lists.
- You cannot have two constructors with the same argument lists. An argument list includes the order and/or type of arguments.
- Instance variables are assigned a default value, even when you don’t explicitly assign one. The default values are 0/0.0/false for primitives, and null for references

## Things to remember about constructors

- A constructor is the code that runs when somebody says new on a class type
``` java
     Duck d = new Duck();
```
- A constructor must have the same name as the class, and no return type
``` java
     public Duck(int size) { };
```
- If you don’t put a constructor in your class, the compiler puts in a default constructor. The default constructor is always a no-arg constructor.
``` java
     public Duck() { }
```
- You can have more than one constructor in your class, as long as the argument lists are different. Having more than one constructor in a class means you have overloaded constructors.
``` java
- public Duck() { }
- public Duck(int size) { }
- public Duck(String name) { }
- public Duck(String name, int size) { };
```
